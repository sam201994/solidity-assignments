# Calculator Smart contract

### Requirement

Write a smart contract in Solidity that implements a basic calculator with the following features:
- Addition: a function that takes two integers and returns their sum.
- Subtraction: a function that takes two integers and returns their difference.
- Multiplication: a function that takes two integers and returns their product.
- Division: a function that takes two integers and returns their quotient.
- Modulo: a function that takes two integers and returns the remainder of their division.

Your smart contract should be able to perform all of these operations and should be well-commented and readable.

### Approaches

Note that your solution may differ from the one given here, but it doesn't necessarily makes it wrong. Example: you may choose to keep the functions `external` if they are never being called from the same contract. You may not keep the result as state variable, instead return the result from the function directly.

### How to run?
Compile and run this code though Remix IDE. Deploy it on preferred network and run different transactions and check the result variable after performing each operation.
