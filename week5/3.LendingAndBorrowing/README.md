# Deposits and Withdrawals (L)

We are not into DeFi here, but deposits and withdrawals are good concepts to work with tokens. The protocols like AAVE and Compound allow users to borrow and lend the tokens. AAVE for example allows for the deposit of USDC and returns an equivalent amount of aUSDC, and so does Compound protocol. These are called receipt tokens. Let us create a sample version of the same. 
 

### Â Requirements
Create a lending and borrowing contract that does the following things. Understand the usage of approve function and use it when required.

1. It allows for the deposit of a whitelisted set of tokens for example WBTC. But should not allows any other tokens to be deposited.

2. Create a sample ERC20 token and deploy it.

3. As the developer of the Lending and Borrowing protocol create receipt tokens for the above tokens.

4. Mint the equivalent number of receipt tokens (rWBTC) to the sender for the amount of (wBTC) tokens deposited.

5. On withdrawal, the user shall send the receipt tokens to receive the equivalent number of WBTC tokens. The receipt tokens shall be burned.

6. (Optional) Add feasibility so that the Protocol owner shall be able to add more tokens to the allowed list
